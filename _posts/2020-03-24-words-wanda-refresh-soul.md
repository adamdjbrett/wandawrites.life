God is always with us! As COVID-19 changes the world around us every day, I want you to know that ministering to you is a priority for our VVCC Women’s Ministry Team. Our goal is to help women feel supported, encouraged and connected during this difficult time.

Pastor Ronda and I were talking this week and we want to provide options for women to receive spiritual help and hope as we navigate our way through this crisis together.

Although our “in person” Village View Ladies Bible Study groups have been temporarily postponed (due to the CDC precautions) I have good news! Lifeway Women is making ten of their video Bible Studies available at Lifewaywomen.com free of charge from now until June 18, 2020\. You may connect with [these powerful Bible Study videos here](https://lifewaywomen.com/2020/03/20/free-online-bible-studies-and-5-ebooks-to-stay-in-the-word/).

When you click on this link, choose a study that interests you to access all the video teachings free of charge. You may want to use the Bible Study book that goes along with the study, it is available for purchase as an eBook for only $5.00. 

If you are uncertain which study to choose first, let me recommend “_Finding I Am_” by Lisa TerKerust. This study is beautifully filmed on location in Israel and is an incredible teaching on the I AM statements of Jesus. 

All of the studies are excellent. If you missed out on our recent study of Joseph’s life let me suggest the fabulous “_Finding God Faithful_” by Kelly Minter.

God is gracious to provide us with so many options to study His Word— even in the middle of a global pandemic. I hope you will join me in choosing a study that will keep you centered and strong.

I want you to know that I look forward to the time that we can all meet together again in the near future. Remember—we’re women—we can do this! We will get through it!

We serve a big God–bigger than any of the fears we are facing right now—and He is always faithful. If you need prayer or help during this time, please email me at [wbrett@villageviewchurch.com](mailto:wbrett@villageviewchurch.com). I would love to hear from you and pray for you. You can send me your updates, news, photos and prayer requests. I want us to pray for each other and encourage each other with God’s Word! I will send out updates to help keep us all connected.

In closing, I want to share this with you so you can write it down, enter it in your phone, or make it your screensaver:

>“I am a woman of courage, faith and influence called to walk with God in this moment!”

Let God’s Word REFRESH your soul,
